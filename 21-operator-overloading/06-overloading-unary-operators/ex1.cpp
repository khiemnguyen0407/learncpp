/* Overloading unary operators +, -, and ! */

/* Unlike the operators youâ€™ve seen so far, the positive (+), negative (-) and logical not (!) 
operators all are unary operators, which means they only operate on one operand. Because they only 
operate on the object they are applied to, typically unary operator overloads are implemented as 
member functions. All three operators are implemented in an identical manner. */
