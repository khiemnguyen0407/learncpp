/* Overloading unary operator ! */

/*
Hereâ€™s another example. The ! operator is the logical negation operator -- if an expression 
evaluates to "true", operator! will return false, and vice-versa. We commonly see this applied to 
boolean variables to test whether they are true or not.

For integers, 0 evaluates to false, and anything else to true, so operator! as applied to integers 
will return true for an integer value of 0 and false otherwise. Extending the concept, we can say 
that operator! should evaluate to true if the state of the object is "false", "zero", or whatever 
the default initialization state is.
