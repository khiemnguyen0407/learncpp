/* Discussion:
Most of the time, you wonâ€™t need to explicitly reference the this pointer. However, there are a 
few occasions where doing so can be useful:
(1) First, if you have a member function that has a parameter with the same name as a data member, 
    you can disambiguate them by using this.
