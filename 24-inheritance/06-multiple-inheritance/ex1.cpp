/* Multiple inheritance */

/*
So far, all of the examples of inheritance weâ€™ve presented have been single inheritance -- that is, 
each inherited class has one and only one parent. However, C++ provides the ability to do multiple 
inheritance. Multiple inheritance enables a derived class to inherit members from more than one 
parent.


Let's say we wanted to write a program to keep track of a bunch of teachers. A teacher is a person. 
However, a teacher is also an employee (they are their own employer if working for themselves). 
Multiple inheritance can be used to create a Teacher class that inherits properties from both 
Person and Employee. To use multiple inheritance, simply specify each base class (just like in 
single inheritance), separated by a comma.
